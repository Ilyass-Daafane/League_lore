            <h2>The unforgotten</h2>
            <h1>YONE</h1>
            <p>In life, he was Yone—half-brother of Yasuo, and renowned student of his village's sword school. But upon his death at the hands of his brother, he found himself hunted by a malevolent entity of the spirit realm, and was forced to slay it with its own sword. Now, cursed to wear its demonic mask upon his face, Yone tirelessly hunts all such creatures in order to understand what he has become.</p>

            <h2>The unforgiven</h2>
            <h1>YASUO</h1>
            <p>An Ionian of deep resolve, Yasuo is an agile swordsman who wields the air itself against his enemies. As a proud young man, he was falsely accused of murdering his master—unable to prove his innocence, he was forced to slay his own brother in self defense. Even after his master's true killer was revealed, Yasuo still could not forgive himself for all he had done, and now wanders his homeland with only the wind to guide his blade.</p>

            <span class="videotext">The conflict between Yasuo and Yone is one that has been a long time in the making. It is a story of two brothers, born of the same parents, yet torn apart by fate. Yasuo was born first and was the favored son, while Yone was born second and was often overlooked. As they grew up, Yasuo became a master swordsman while Yone trained in the ways of magic and sorcery. Despite their differences, both brothers were incredibly talented and powerful, but their paths eventually diverged when Yasuo was accused of a crime he did not commit. This led to a rift between the two, which eventually resulted in a final battle between them. The result of the battle was unfortunate as it led to yone's death by the hands of his beloved brother, but the story of Yasuo and Yone's conflict is one that will live on in the hearts of many.</span>
